# Pokedex with express server.
This application was created with React and MobX (state manager).

List pokemons in a card view with their name, avatar, type (should visually look as a colored tag) and the main pokemon stats.

When you click on a pokemon in the list, some additional detailed information will be shown.

The list have a pagination with an ability to select how many items to show per page (20 / 50 / 100).

Filter the pokemons by name with a search box.

Filter the pokemons by type using tags (multiple selected tags show pokemons with any of the types selected).

All this features are implemented on the backend using node.js
